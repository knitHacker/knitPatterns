What I want it to do 
- store patterns
- input patterns
    + pdfs?
    + text files to begin
    + define sub-language
    + translate old patterns to IR
    + easly 
    + intuitively
- display patterns
    + succingtly
    + both chart / text
    + subset of pattern ("square" showing around rows / columns)
    + interactively?
    + realistically display fabric
- generate more pattern
    + more rows
    + more repeats in a row
    + stretch goal - generate pattern from collection of patterns even when
      adding new patterns with new stitches
- compose patterns
    + more than one pattern in a row
    + panels / horizontally and vertically
    + fill in if increasing
- check patterns
    + verify rows from -> to match
    + check if pattern doesn't make sense (ie. knitting into YO in a row)
- encode size into patterns
- encode color patterns 
- encode lace patterns
- encode increases and decreases
- round vs. back and forth
- whole pattern representation?
    + multiple pieces of fabric
    + instructions / sewing
    + support picking up stitches?
