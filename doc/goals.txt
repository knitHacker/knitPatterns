What I want it to do 
- store patterns
- input patterns
    + easly 
    + intuitively
- display patterns
    + succingtly
    + interactively?
    + realistically display fabric
- generate more pattern
    + more rows
    + more repeats in a row
- compose patterns
    + more than one pattern in a row
    + 
- encode size into patterns
- encode color patterns 
- encode lace patterns
- encode increases and decreases
- round vs. back and forth
- whole pattern representation 
    + multiple pieces of fabric
    + instructions / sewing
